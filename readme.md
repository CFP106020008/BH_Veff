Hi, welcome!
This is a simple code I wrote for my High Energy Astrophysics class.
The code plots the effective potential around a Schwarzchild black hole, and then animate it with GIF format.
If you want to use the code, please ```git clone``` it and create an ```images``` folder to store the output images.
After that, simply do ```./run.sh``` should do the trick.

Actually, my homework does not ask us to do animation. Nonetheless, I think this is cool and is very suitable for educational purposes.
Feel free to contact me if you have any question or comments!
