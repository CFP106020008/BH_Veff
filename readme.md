Hi and welcome!

This is a simple code I wrote for my homework in High Energy Astrophysics class.

The code plots the effective potential around a Schwarzchild black hole, and then animate it in GIF format.

If you want to use the code, please ```git clone``` it and create an ```images``` folder to store the output images.

After that, simply run ```./run.sh``` should do the trick.

I think this is cool and is very suitable for educational purposes.
Feel free to contact me if you have any question or comments!
